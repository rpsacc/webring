# Webring

 This webring is an attempt to inspire my network to quit closed-platforms, build their websites, and share traffic among each other. 

## Join the webring

```
<a href='https://webring.rpsa.cc/#random' target='_blank'><img src='https://webring.rpsa.cc/icon.black-2.svg'/></a>
```

1. Add the webring icon to your website html.
2. Send me an email with a link to your website. You can send me the link of your RSS feed, and twtxt, if you use that.

### Webring criteria

**Single page websites, websites acting only as portals to platforms (i.e. Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc), or websites with violent, racist, sexist or speciesist content will be rejected**.

The aim of the webring is to display hand-crafted personal websites showcasing the people's works. Your business site is probably not the best fit for the webring, and will be rejected. 

If your website requires Javascript to display the majority of its content or to navigate, it will be rejected. Your website must count at least 3 pages and include an about page. You must have your own domain name, we do not accept `github.io` subdomains, or other platform's subdomains.

If it's seen that your website is in violation to any of these rules your site will be removed from the webring. If you fix the issues, feel free to submit another PR to join back in.

### Circular Linking

Instead of linking to the directory, you can also link to the previous link in the ring by adding parts of your site or domain in the hash of the request url:

```
<a href='https://webring.rpsa.cc/#rpsa' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src='https://webring.rpsa.cc/icon.black-2.svg'/></a>
```

## Help

The ring is managed by [@yourcontact](https://rpsa.cc), but any member of the webring is welcome to join this repository as a collaborator.
